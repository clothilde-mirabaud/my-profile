		<h2 class="text-center"> Internship </h2>
		<p> This summer, I did an internship in an audit company (Grant Thorton) and it led me to think I wanted to do finance. 2 years ago, I also did an internship at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and it was really fulfilling, because I watched people who have to deal with crises everyday, and manage it. I was really admirative.</p>
